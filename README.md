## Why KrishiSahai?

### Data-Driven Decision Making
Move beyond guesswork. Every insight provided by KrishiSahai is tailored to your land size, soil health, capital availability, and local micro-climate.

### Radical Accessibility
The platform is built for everyone. With a robust multilingual interface and voice-first interaction, we ensure that advanced technology is accessible to every farmer, regardless of digital literacy level.

### Circular Economy Focus
We dont just focus on the harvest. Our Waste-to-Value engine ensures that every gram of agricultural residue is utilized, increasing farmer income and reducing environmental impact.

## Technical Landscape

The platform utilizes a state-of-the-art tech stack designed for high performance and scalability:

- **Frontend**: A high-performance React 19 application built with TypeScript for absolute reliability.
- **Backend**: A modular Flask (Python) infrastructure orchestrating complex ML workflows.
- **Intelligence**: A tiered AI approach using Google Gemini for reasoning and local Ollama models for privacy.
- **Computer Vision**: Specialized deep learning models (CNN & YOLO) for high-accuracy diagnostics.
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade authentication and real-time data persistence powered by Firebase.
